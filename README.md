# Edbert-s-Portofolio
This is a collection of some of the projects that I have done
1. DIRGA KIT - Final Project
For this final project, me and my team made a set of devices to help aid search and rescue. My role is to help develop the GUI to ease configuration and visualization of data.

2. Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition 2019
For this competition, my team developed an unconventional UAV (90o rotated bicopter with wheels)
